# sbt-groll #

Plugin for [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) to "roll" – view and navigate – the
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) commit history. This turns out to be very useful for live coding and
training sessions. As of version 5 sbt-groll depends on [sbt-git](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-git),
i.e. a local Git installation can be used, but is not needed.

## Installing sbt-groll ##

sbt-groll is a plugin for sbt 1.0.0 or higher. In order to install sbt, please refer to the
[sbt documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html). Please make
sure that you are using a suitable version of sbt:

As sbt-groll is a plugin for sbt, it is installed like any other sbt plugin, that is by mere
configuration: just add sbt-groll to your global or local plugin definition. Global plugins are
defined in `~/.sbt/<sbt_version>/plugins/plugins.sbt` and local plugins are defined in
`project/plugins.sbt` in your project.

In order to add sbt-groll as a plugin, just add the below setting to the relevant plugin definition:

```
addSbtPlugin("de.heikoseeberger" % "sbt-groll" % "6.1.0")
```

After adding the sbt-groll plugin like this, you should either start sbt or, if it was already
started, reload the current session by executing the `reload` command. If everything worked, you
should have the new `groll` command available.

## Using sbt-groll ##

sbt-groll adds the `groll` command that provides various ways to view and navigate the Git history.
Of course this means, that you can only use sbt-groll for projects which are using Git as version
control system.

If you navigate the Git history, i.e. move to some commit, sbt-groll reloads the sbt session if the
build definition changes, i.e. any `.sbt` file in the project root directory or any `.scala` or
`.sbt` file in the `project/` directory.

In order to use sbt-groll, just execute `groll <arg_or_opt>` in an sbt session, giving one of the
arguments or options described below. Here are two examples:

```
> groll show
[info] == 0bf1f60 Exercise: Connect to a remote system> groll move=bc1ac93
> groll head
[info] >> b97ef22 Exercise: HTTP server
```

## Settings ##

sbt-groll can be configured by the following settings:

- `grollConfigFile: java.io.File` – the configuration file for sbt-groll; "~/.sbt-groll.conf" by
  default
- `grollHistoryRef: String` – the ref (commit id, branch or tag) used for the Git history; "main"
  by default
- `grollWorkingBranch: String` – the working branch used by sbt-groll; "groll" by default

## Arguments/options ##

The `groll` command must be followed by one of the following arguments or options:

- `show` – shows the current commit id and message, if current commit is in history
- `list` – shows the full commit history
- `next` – moves to the next commit
- `prev` – moves to the previous commit
- `head` – moves to the head of the commit history
- `initial` – moves to a commit with a message containing "groll:initial" or starting with "Initial
state" or with a tag "groll-initial"
- `move=<commit>` – moves to the given commit
- `push=<branch>` – pushes the current commit via HTTPS to the "origin-https" remote repository
  (needs to be defined!) under the given branch
- `help` - shows this help info.
